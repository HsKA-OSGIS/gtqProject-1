				getThereQuick (gtQ) is a website, designed by Maclean Commey and Monale Langa concentrating in the warm country of South Africa. The buzzing city of Johannesburg situated north of South Africa, created for the locals and jetsetters (travellers) to have a one stop place, 
				just a click away where they can view which routes to use, Places to visit, entertainment to attend in order to keep them on their toes away from their everyday busy life…transport to use that is cost effective and safe or even better which routes to avoid so you don’t spend your time stuck in traffic..
				Lets get started…

	<img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Slide 1" />
    <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Slide 2" />
    <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="Slide 3" />    
    <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="Slide 4" />
	<img src="images/5.jpg" alt="Slide 5" />
	<img src="images/6.jpg" alt="Slide 6" />

				<br />
				pgRouting is an algorithm to calculates distance and direction of a road. One can view the route to use by clicking on the point of interest on the map and the route will get calculated for you …this project is concentrating on major routes then in-between one 
				can switch to the live-traffic to view which routes to avoid based on the results of the route chosen.
				<p>
				<br />
				The User can then navigate to other pages available which explore the City of Johannesburg more depending on the interest of the user, there’s always something to do in a city that never sleeps..perhaps it’s the long lost child of New York…
